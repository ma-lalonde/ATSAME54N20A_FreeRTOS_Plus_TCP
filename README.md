ATSAME54N20A_FreeRTOS_Plus_TCP
==============================

This is a simple demo of an in progress FreeRTOS+TCP driver for the ATSAME54N20A (SAM E54), which should also work for any SAM E5X.
The board consists of a ATSAME54N20A and a KSZ8081RNAIA, both powered by a +3V3 LDO regulator and fed by a 25 MHz clock.
The PCB might be published later, when the rest of the hardware is fully validated.
